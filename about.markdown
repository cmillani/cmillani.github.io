My name is Carlos, I'm a brazilian software engineer and this is a place where I'll share some of my thought and experiments on computer science. Some academic stuff, other hobby and tinkering projects, and enterprise insights.

One day during a job interview I was described as a mad scientist, due to all the tinkering I like to do at home. At that time I was at the beginning of my homelab, I had just installed CUPS on a raspberry pi and turned my cabled printer into an wireless printer (wow!). Since then, I found the rabbit hole that is having a server at home, and have been adding to it ever since.

Well, this is a WIP, I'll add more as the blog grows, now let me try to put this online first :p
