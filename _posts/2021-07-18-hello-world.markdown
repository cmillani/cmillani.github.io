For a while now I wanted a place where I could share some of my experiments and studies.

Since 2020 I've started a [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) (link to the reddit community, where I got many ideas), and from then on I worked on a few projects.

I wanted a place where I could share these and other projects with the world, telling a bit more about myself and hopefully contributing a little bit with this wonderful community.

Since I wanted a simple template, where I could write without having to worry much about js, css and html, when I discovered that [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) seems to have a pretty neat integration with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), I decided to give it a shot as the first version of my personal blog!

So, this is it! Nothing fancy, just a place to easily share some of my ideas and experiments.
