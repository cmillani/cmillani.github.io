&lt;p&gt;Since 2020 I’ve started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/&quot;&gt;homelab&lt;/a&gt; (link to the reddit community, where I got many ideas), and from then on I worked on a few projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a place where I could share these and other projects with the world, telling a bit more about myself and hopefully contributing a little bit with this wonderful community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted a simple template, where I could write without having to worry much about js, css and html, when I discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; seems to have a pretty neat integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to give it a shot as the first version of my personal blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is it! Nothing fancy, just a place to easily share some of my ideas and experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="kubernetes" /><summary type="html">For a while now I wanted a place where I could share some of my experiments and studies.</summary></entry></feed>
